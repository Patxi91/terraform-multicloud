# Terraform-Zero-to-Hero

This repository contains resources and code examples for getting started with Terraform, an open-source infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. In this series, we will explore how to use Terraform to automate and manage infrastructure deployments on AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## Day 1: Getting Started with Terraform

In this section, we will cover the basics of Terraform and how to set it up for various cloud providers.

### 1. Introduction to Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Learn the fundamentals of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how Terraform enables you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure declaratively.

### 2. Installing Terraform
Instructions for installing Terraform on different operating systems:
- **MacOS**: Using Homebrew or manual download.
- **Linux**: Using package managers or manual download.
- **Windows**: Using Chocolatey or manual download.

### 3. Setting Up Terraform for AWS
- Configuring Terraform to work with AWS by setting up credentials and permissions.
- Writing your first Terraform configuration to define AWS resources.

### 4. Writing Your First Terraform Code
- Understand the basic structure of a Terraform configuration file.
- Create your first Terraform project and deploy an AWS resource (e.g., EC2 instance).

## Terraform Life Cycle

This section covers the core Terraform workflow, from writing code to applying it and managing infrastructure.

### 1. Launching an EC2 Instance on AWS
- Example code to launch an EC2 instance using Terraform.
- Explanation of Terraform commands like `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`.

### 2. Understanding Terraform State Basics
- How Terraform manages the state of infrastructure.
- Best practices for managing Terraform state securely.

## GCP and Azure Setup

Learn how to set up and use Terraform with other major cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure.

### 1. Setting Up Terraform for GCP
- Configuring Terraform to work with GCP by setting up credentials and permissions.
- Writing Terraform code to launch a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance.

### 2. Setting Up Terraform for Azure
- Configuring Terraform to work with Azure by setting up credentials and permissions.
- Writing Terraform code to launch a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure.
