# Terraform Learning Repository

Welcome to the Terraform Learning Repository. This repository contains detailed markdown guides on various Terraform concepts, from providers to variables, regions, conditional expressions, and more. It is designed to help users understand and implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.

## 1. Providers

The [01-providers.md](01-providers.md) file explains what providers are in Terraform. Providers are responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources within Terraform. This section will guide you on how to configure providers for different platforms.

## 2. Multiple Providers

In [02-multiple-providers.md](02-multiple-providers.md), you'll learn how to configure and manage multiple providers within a single Terraform configuration, which is useful when managing resources across different platforms or services.

## 3. Multiple Regions

The [03-multiple-regions.md](03-multiple-regions.md) guide explains how to configure Terraform to manage resources across multiple regions. This is especially useful for multi-region deployments or DR (disaster recovery) setups.

## 4. Required Providers

In [04-required-providers.md](04-required-providers.md), you’ll explore the concept of required providers and how to ensure that specific versions of providers are used within your Terraform configuration.

## 5. Variables

The [05-variables.md](05-variables.md) file covers the use of variables in Terraform. Variables provide a way to make Terraform configurations flexible and reusable by abstracting configuration values.

## 6. Variables Implementation

In [06-variables-implementation.md](06-variables-implementation.md), you'll find hands-on implementation examples of how to define, reference, and pass variables in your Terraform configurations.

## 7. Using tfvars

The [07-tfvars.md](07-tfvars.md) document dives into the `.tfvars` files, which are used to pass input variable values when running Terraform commands, allowing for greater modularity and flexibility.

## 8. Conditional Expressions

In [08-conditional-expressions.md](08-conditional-expressions.md), you'll explore how to use conditional expressions in Terraform to define dynamic behavior, allowing for more sophisticated configurations.

## 9. Built-in Functions

The [09-builtin-functions.md](09-builtin-functions.md) file provides an overview of Terraform’s built-in functions. These functions are used to manipulate and transform data within your configurations.
